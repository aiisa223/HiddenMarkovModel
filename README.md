My own interpretation of the Hidden Markov Model as described in https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7072/6/2/36#sec4-ijfs-06-00036 
It has been optimized to work best on stocks. I use AIC, BIC, HQC, and CAIC to examine the performances of HMM with numbers of states from two to six. This module uses 4 states.
